# fourier-demo
A demonstration of how Fourier series can fit variable star light curves.

`demo.py` can be used to generate a demo for any variable star, given the data. Run `python3 demo.py --help` for details.

A slideshow containing demos for some stars is available [here](https://astroswego.github.io/fourier-demo/fourier-slideshow.pdf).
